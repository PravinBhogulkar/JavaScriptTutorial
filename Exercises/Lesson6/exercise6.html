<!-- Booleans and If-Statements -->

<!-- Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day
 (use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23) 
 1. If hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good Morning!' in the console.
 2. If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good Afternoon!' in the console.
 3. Otherwise, display 'Good Night!' in the console
 
 Continuing above, create a variable called 'name' and save your name inside (as a string).
 Update the if-statement to display your name in each message.
 For example: 'Good Morning ${name}!'-->

 <!-- Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
  1. Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
  2. Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount.
  If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
  Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
  3. Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages. -->

  <!-- Continuing above, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. 
   Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
   1. Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
   Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets() to control which code gets done first.
   2. Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages. -->
